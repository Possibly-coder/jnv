JNV Play Store Assets
=====================

This folder contains branding files you can upload to Google Play Console.

- Phone screenshots are still required by Play Console and must be captured from the running app.
- Launcher icons for Android and iOS are generated from `assets/jnv-logo.png` via `flutter_launcher_icons`.
